# Ipsum API

**From this project I learn the basics of building REST APIs and the methods for request-response pattern.**

This is a Node.js Lorem Ipsum REST API and was my first API I've made. It's connected to a Postgres database with different types of Lorem Ipsum variants are present. Depending on the request one may fetch a specific ipsum or *any* ipsum.

This project later led to a separate builerplate repo for quickly creating Node.js APIs and is available at [Sample Nodejs API](https://github.com/chrismessiah/sample-nodejs-api)
